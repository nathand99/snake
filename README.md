# Snake

Snake is a game made using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) Python library. After reading a tutorial on Pygame and looking at some code, I decided to whip up something and this snake game was created. It was a fun game to make and pygame is the perfect library to use if you want to quickly make a game like snake.  

## Installation

The only package needed is Pygame.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 snake.py
```
Adjusting the squares and speed variables in snake.py can change up the game to your liking

## Controls
- Use arrow keys or WASD to move snake and collect as many apples as you want. You cannot move in the opposite direction that the snake is facing.
- Do not hit your tail or the walls or it will be GAME OVER
- Press p to pause. Press any key to unpause.
- On the GAME OVER screen, press any button to restart the game.
